Release [1.2][release] of Equations is available, as source and
through `opam` (packages `coq-equations.1.2+8.8` and
`coq-equations.1.2+8.9` for Coq 8.8 and Coq 8.9).

  I am pleased to announce release 1.2 of the [Equations][www]
package. Equations is a function definition plugin for Coq, that supports
the definition of functions by dependent pattern-matching and structural
or well-founded, mutual or nested recursion and compiles them into core
Coq terms without axioms. It automatically derives the clauses'
equations, the graph of the function and its associated elimination
principle. 

  This release contains a few fixes and improvements with respect to the
[1.2beta2][12beta2release] version:

  - Fixed an annoying backtracking bug when using `Equations?` (issue
    #179, thanks to Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot for help fixing this).

  - Fixed the treatment of `with` with more than 2 arguments (issue
    #190)
    
  - Fixed "cannot be used as a hint" errors (issue #193), now turned
    into warnings.
    
  - Granted with #187: global `Set Equations Derive Equations/Eliminator` options.
    
The previous [beta1][12betarelease] and [beta2][12beta2release]
announcements describe the new features of the 1.2 version.  See the
[reference manual][refman] for up-to-date syntax and description of the
new features. The [Equations Reloaded][equations-reloaded]
paper also provides an introduction to the new version.
