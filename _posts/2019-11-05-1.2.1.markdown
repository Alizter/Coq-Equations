Release [1.2.1][release] of Equations is available, as source and
through `opam` packages `coq-equations.1.2.1+8.9`, `coq-equations.1.2.1+8.10` 
for Coq 8.9 and Coq 8.10.

  The 8.10 version (only) includes support for the HoTT library (currently available
in Coq's `extra-dev` repository only as `coq-hott-8.10.dev`). Install `coq-hott` before
Equations to get a version that uses the HoTT library. 
Note that only one of the HoTT variant or the standard variant can be installed
at any given time. Using `hoqtop` or `hoqc`, one needs to pass the following additional
options:

    hoqtop/hoqc -I `coqc -where`/user-contrib/Equations -Q `coqc -where`/user-contrib ""

Then, one can import the plugin in Coq, using:

    From Equations Require Import HoTT.All.

See the [Reference Manual][refman] for an introduction to Equations,
or the [ICFP paper][equations-reloaded].
