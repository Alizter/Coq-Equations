\section{Experimentation: a bit-fiddling library}

We finally come to an experiment using \Equations, developping a library
on the bit representation of numbers. We wrote a library to 
manipulate signed and unsigned representations of numbers of fixed but
arbitrary length. The library handles the basic operations on
numbers with carries and borrows. More importantly, it provides proofs
about these operations, using as a model the mathematical structures
corresponding to them, in this case naturals and integers. Another layer
providing a modular arithmetic model should be easy to add.

\subsection{Binary representations}

Our implementation of binary numbers is based on the \ind{vector}
datatype. A bit is simply represented as a \ind{bool}ean.
So a 32 bit word is simply a $\ind{vector}~\ind{bool}~32$.
