\title{\Equations\\
  A dependent pattern-matching compiler}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We present a compiler for definitions made by pattern matching on
  inductive families in the \Coq system. It allows to write structured,
  recursive dependently-typed functions as a set of equations,
  automatically find their realization in the core type theory and
  generate proofs to ease reasoning on them.
  It provides a complete package to define 
  and reason on functions in the proof assistant, substantially
  reducing the boilerplate code and proofs one usually has to write, 
  also hiding the intricacies related to the use of dependent types and
  complex recursion schemes.
